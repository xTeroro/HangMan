This is a HangMan game that I've build myself from scratch.

It has 2 different gamemodes and it lets you to select your own words or choose randomly one of the words from the words.txt file.

For a custom words file you'll need to put all the words on different lines for it to work and it to be named words.txt otherwise the game won't run.
